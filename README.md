## UEFI IFR edits
Ahead of installing, as with other hackintoshes you will need to disable 
CFG_LOCK using modGRUBshell as follows:

```bash
setup_var_cv CpuSetup 0x43 0x00
```

## Misc
To allow the laptop to function in clamshell mode, you need to press Fn+F8 
on the clover boot menu to switch to the external display. That way the 
laptop LVDS screen is switched off and the external monitor is on. You 
need to connect a USB/Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, but the setup is much 
more practical in this way.
